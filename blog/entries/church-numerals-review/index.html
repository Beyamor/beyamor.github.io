     <p>I'm reading through a bit of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start">SICP</a> right now and came across an example problem which casually throws <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_numeral">Church Numerals</a> in your face.</p>
     <p>Man, listen, I'm pretty dumb. I know that. You know that. People I pass on the street know that, deep in their hearts and with the certainty of <em>fact</em>.</p>
     <p>Anyway, Church Numerals. I stumble on 'em every time I come across 'em. Them and the rest of lambda calculus really, jeez, it just falls right out of my head. So, let me go ahead and capture my understanding in a blog before it escapes again.</p>
     <p>Church Numerals are just natural numbers, simple as that. The thing is, though, and this is neat, they're numbers <em>without</em> numbers - they're encoded with functions. It's, okay, check it.</p>
     <p>Instead of thinking of numbers as, well, numbers, we can think of them as things which can apply a function some number of times. Whoa, easy there, don't worry, we'll take it slow.</p>
     <p>Okay, so, let's start with zero. Our function <code>zero</code> will take a function <code>f</code> and return a function which will apply it <em>zero</em> times. Easy-peasy:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">zero =
	# given f
	(f) -&gt;
		# return a function of x
		(x) -&gt;
			# which doesn't apply f to x
			return x</code></pre>
     <p>Now, the increment function <code>inc</code> will take a number and return its successor - i.e., a function that applies <code>f</code> one additional time. Shouldn't be too bad:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">inc =
	# given n-1
	(prevN) -&gt;
		# return a function which takes f
		(f) -&gt;
			# and returns a function of x
			(x) -&gt;
				# which applies f to x n-1 times
				result = prevN(f)(x)

				# and applies f once more
				return f(result)</code></pre>
     <p>Given <code>inc</code>, we can define a couple of other numbers for the hell of it:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">one	= inc zero
two	= inc one</code></pre>
     <p>Now that we've our beautiful-looking numbers, how do we use 'em? Remember, given a number, we can pass it a function <code>f</code> and it'll return a function which applies <code>f</code> n times. So, let's say we were really interested in adding periods to things. We could write an <code>addPeriod</code> function:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">addPeriod = (s) -&gt;
	return s + "."</code></pre>
     <p>And we use this with a string, obvs:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">addPeriod("")
# =&gt; "."</code></pre>
     <p>Using our numbers, we can apply this bad boy zero times:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">zero(addPeriod)("")
# =&gt; ""</code></pre>
     <p>How dang exciting is that? Our zero produced zero periods by applying <code>addPeriod</code> zero times! Just like you'd expect!</p>
     <p>Okay, I can see it in your eyes. You want something with a little more razzle-dazzle. Well, prepare to get your mind blown. Let's check out the number two:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">two(addPeriod)("")
# =&gt; ".."</code></pre>
     <p>Rad, right? <code>two</code> calls <code>one</code>, <code>one</code> calls <code>zero</code>, <code>zero</code> returns <code>""</code>, <code>one</code> adds a period, and finally, <code>two</code> adds another period. Couldn't be simpler.</p>
     <p>Boy, ain't this grand? I can't imagine why anybody would represent numbers the old, boring way ever again.</p>
