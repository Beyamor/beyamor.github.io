     <p>Last weekend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/UVicGameDev">UVIc GameDev</a> had a tiny little game jam, lovingly labelled "NoJam2012" by me and me alone. The jam's themes of this bad boy were "juice," "emergent behaviour," and "kill streaks." Michael Pattie drank about a dozen Dr. Peppers and Bearded Rob taught us how to say raunchy things in Spanish.</p>
     <p>My tender little gift to the world is a game called <em>sapce</em>. As an idea, it's this sort of evolution sim with spaceships because if there's anything Charles Darwin was big on, it was spaceships. Anyway, to be honest, the game is basically <a href="http://boxcar2d.com/">BoxCar 2D</a> that looks like <a href="http://www.captainforever.com/captainforever.php">Captain Forever</a> but whatevs.</p>
     <p>You should go play those, by the way. Like, now.</p>
     <p>I wrote the thing in Python with <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/">Pybox2D</a>. And, unfortunately, I had so much fun doing so that I didn't stop. So, I'm still writing code for this dinky little side project and I feel bad because there's a dozen other projects I should tackle, but damn if this isn't enjoyable. This is the new hotness. If you want, you can <a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/sapce">check out the gross, uncommented code</a>.</p>
