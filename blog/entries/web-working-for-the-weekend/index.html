    <div id="content">
     <p>I'd like to think I'm a patient guy. I'm pretty good about waiting for things. One time, I spent over half an hour waiting for a kettle to boil. Turns out it wasn't plugged in. Maybe not too bright, but patient.</p>
     <p>You know who is in much need of this most precious virtue? Web browsers, for one. If your script takes just a little too long to finish, the browser throws up this big <a href="http://windows.fyicenter.com/mozilla_firefox_unresponsive_script_warning.jpg">hissy fit</a>. <em>Ridiculous</em>.</p>
     <p>Anyway, being the kind and considerate folks we are, let's see if we can't assuage that impatience some.</p>
     <h1 id="just-five-more-minutes">Just Five More Minutes</h1>Games like Herrera which procedurally generate their levels often need to set aside a healthy chunk of time for the building process. To keep the users happy, you'll want to throw a progress screen over this. To keep the browsers happy, you'll want to do the work without blocking the main thread.
     <p>In the JavaScript world, doing work in a non-blocking manner used to be a difficult proposition. Since things were only operating on a single thread, you'd have to do a bit of work, save your state, take a break so the rest of the world got some time to shine, then pick up where you left off.</p>
     <p>Yeah, it was a bit of a mess.</p>
     <p>Lucky for us, browsers are now offering <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers">web workers</a>. A web worker is effectively a separate thread which runs in the background and can communicate with the main window via message passing. Cool, right?</p>
     <p>So, hey, that puts us in a pretty good place. We can foist the level construction off on a web worker and display a nice progress screen until it finishes. We're talking about something like this:</p>
     <div class="img-container">
      <img alt="web worker process" src="http://i.imgur.com/6cgGBR8.png">
     </div>
     <p>Sound good?</p>
     <h1 id="spotlight-on-the-background">Spotlight On The Background</h1>It took a bit of, uh, twiddling, but it turns out, this isn't too hard.
     <p>Transitioning from the existing, blocking code to the web worker stuff required a bit of rewriting, as we'll discuss later, but for the most part, it was just a matter of calling the level construction stuff from inside a web worker instead of the main thread. Simple as that.</p>
     <p>So, we create a web worker by giving it a script to run. Easy enough:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">worker = new Worker 'js/game/levels/build-script.js'</code></pre>
     <p>Once it's been created, the worker will automatically execute the contents of the given script. Hey, what's say we take a look at that script?</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">importScripts '../../require.js'

pendingLayout = null
self.onmessage = (event) -&gt;
	pendingLayout = event.data

require {
		urlArgs: 'bust=' + (new Date()).getTime(),
		baseUrl: '../../',
	},
	['game/levels'],
	(levels) =&gt;
		construct = (layout) =&gt;
			postMessage(levels.construct layout)
			self.close()

		if pendingLayout?
			construct pendingLayout
		else
			self.onmessage = (event) =&gt;
				construct event.data</code></pre>
     <p>Inside the worker, <code>importScripts</code> is used to load additional scripts. Thankfully, <a href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a>, the module manager I'm using, is all set to work inside of a web worker already, so once that was imported, we could just require modules as normal.</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">importScripts '../../require.js'</code></pre>
     <p>Awkwardly, the path is relative to the location of the executing script, not the web page, hence the brittle <code>..</code>. Oh well. At this point, we can <code>require</code> the <code>levels</code> module (which, in turn, will require stuff like the <code>rooms</code> module).</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">require {
		urlArgs: 'bust=' + (new Date()).getTime(),
		baseUrl: '../../',
	},
	['game/levels'],
	(levels) =&gt;
		# the good stuff</code></pre>
     <p>Like I mentioned above, communication between the web worker and the main thread is done via message passing. Messages are sent with the <code>postMessage</code> method and received with the <code>onmessage</code> method. Since we're intending to pass a layout to the worker, we need to set <code>onmessage</code> to receive one.</p>
     <p>Before we can construct a level for a layout, we need to load the <code>levels</code> module. Since we don't have any guarantee about <em>when</em> the layout will be received, we actually end up with two different message handling behaviours. Initially, before the <code>levels</code> module is loaded, we set <code>onmessage</code> to take note of a <em>pending</em> layout:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">pendingLayout = null
self.onmessage = (event) -&gt;
	pendingLayout = event.data</code></pre>
     <p>Once the module has been loaded, we check if we have a pending layout. If we do, we construct it immediately; otherwise, we set <code>onmessage</code> to construct the next layout it receives:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">if pendingLayout?
	construct pendingLayout
else
	self.onmessage = (event) =&gt;
		layout = event.data
		construct layout</code></pre>
     <p>Given the layout, we can construct it, send the completed level to the main thread, then terminate the worker:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">construct = (layout) =&gt;
	postMessage(levels.construct layout)
	self.close()</code></pre>
     <p>We just have to hook up the main thread to receive a completed level, then we can pass the worker a layout, throw up our building screen, and sit tight until the worker finishes:</p>
     <pre><code class="language-coffee">worker = new Worker 'js/game/levels/build-script.js'
worker.onmessage = (event) =&gt;
	@levelBuilt(event.data)

layout = levelLayouts.create()
worker.postMessage layout

@buildingScreen = new BuildingScreen
@buildingScreen.show()</code></pre>
     <p>And that's all basically there is to it. We've now got multithreaded JavaScript. As the kids say, <em>swagga swag</em>.</p>
     <h1 id="web-worst">Web Worst</h1>There's two big things that tripped me up.
     <p>First, when you send a message to the web worker, you're basically stuck sending a JSON structure - importantly, that means you can't have any functions on that son-of-a-gun. For me, making this work meant rewriting OO-style code in a procedural fashion. Bang away on some JSON, call it day.</p>
     <p>The second caveat is that, as far as I can tell, any scripts included in the web worker need to be served from the same domain as the script. Since I'm using a CDN for most of my libraries, this ain't too good. Luckily, a little rewriting (plus some duplication of <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore's</a> functionality) got rid of those external dependencies. Whoo.</p>
     <p>So, I dunno, the second point is a bit more of a bummer because you end up sacrificing either convenience or simplicity and it's just, <em>yeugh</em>. Still, something like level generation isn't likely to require a ton of libraries anyway, so it's not the end of the world.</p>
     <h1 id="worth-the-work">Worth The Work</h1>The big question is, is using a web worker justified? Well, it's more effort than writing plain old blocking code, but certainly less complex than the ad hoc <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">CSP</a> one might otherwise use. Moreover, long-running blocking code really isn't an option - bad for the browser, bad for the user.
     <p>There are penalties - cloning of transmitted data; repeated evaluation of scripts; other, uh, thready stuff - so they're not the sort of thing you want to pull out willy-nilly, but then, for short-running tasks, you've got the clumsy-but-loveable blocking code you've always had.</p>
     <p>So, hey, if you've got something that lends itself well to stewing away in the background for a while, web workers seem like the way to go.</p>
