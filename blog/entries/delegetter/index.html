For example, in <a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/jinn?source=cc">Jinn</a>, I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorating</a> cameras. Though each camera decorator has its own behaviour - say, staying within some bounds - it'll delegate to the camera it decorates for things like the position and the viewing dimensions.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">less powerful</a> language, setting up delegation often means a lot of boilerplate:</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">class Delegate
	delegatedProperty: &quot;delegate property&quot;

class Delegater
	myDelegate: new Delegate

	Object.defineProperty @prototype,
		&quot;delegatedProperty&quot;,
		get: -&gt;
			@myDelegate.delegatedProperty

		set: (value) -&gt;
			@myDelegate.delegatedProperty = value

delegater = new Delegater
console.log delegater.delegatedProperty
# =&gt; &quot;delegate property&quot;</code></pre><p>How awful would it be if every time you want to delegate a property, you had to write that same chunk of code? Thankfully, JavaScript lets us do some really <del>horrific</del> cool things and CoffeeScript gives us a nice way of writing them.</p><h1>On The Right Syntracks</h1>For something like this, I think the right way to go is to pin down the syntax and then, y'know, make it happen. Don't sweat the implementation, just focus on what it is you're trying to say.<p>What we want to be able to do is declare the delegates and the properties we're delegating to them. Should look something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">class Delegater
	myDelegate: new Delegate

	@delegate
		myDelegate: [&quot;delegatedProperty&quot;]</code></pre><p>If we wanted to set up more delegations, we'd get something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">class Foo
	myBar:	new Bar
	myBaz:	new Baz

	@delegate
		myBar:	[&quot;bar&quot;]
		myBaz:	[&quot;baz&quot;, &quot;moreBaz&quot;]</code></pre><p>Simple enough, right? Let's make it happen.</p><h1>Delegreatness</h1>CoffeeScript's class definition is actually hella nice. We can execute arbitrary expressions and <code>this</code> refers to the constructor function. That opens the language up to simple, but powerful metaprogramming.<p>What we're gunna do is add a function to the <code>Function</code> prototype called <code>delegate</code>. This'll take the delegation specs and set them up. Because it's attached to the <code>Function</code> prototype, we can call call <code>delegate</code> from the class definition with <code>@delegate</code>, just like we wanted.</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">Function::delegate = (specs) -&gt;
	# make it happen</code></pre><p>To call this, we pass it the specs. This is just a JavaScript object, but CoffeeScript's syntax makes this incredibly clean. With parens, it'd look more like this:</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">class Foo
	myBar:	new Bar
	myBaz:	new Baz

	@delegate({
		myBar:	[&quot;bar&quot;],
		myBaz:	[&quot;baz&quot;, &quot;moreBaz&quot;]
	})</code></pre><p /><p>Now we can move the boilerplate stuff into the <code>delegate</code> function, iterating over the specs to define our property delegations. Since JavaScript let us do string-based property access with the <code>[]</code> notation, this is just as straightforward as you could hope:</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">Function::delegate = (specs) -&gt;
	for delegate, properties of specs
		for property in properties
			do (delegate, property) =&gt;
				Object.defineProperty @prototype,
					property,
					get: -&gt;
						this[delegate][property]
					set: (val) -&gt;
						this[delegate][property] = val</code></pre><p>And everything <em>just works</em>:</p><pre><code class="language-coffee">class Delegater
	myDelegate: new Delegate

	@delegate
		myDelegate:	[&quot;delegatedProperty&quot;]

delegater = new Delegater
console.log delegater.delegatedProperty
# =&gt; &quot;delegate property&quot;</code></pre><p>Pretty rad, right? And you could take this even further. For example, set up <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6491463/accessing-nested-javascript-objects-with-string-key">a dot syntax</a> for delegation to nested objects or use a syntax like <code>{from: &quot;property&quot;, to: &quot;delegatedProperty&quot;}</code> to map between properties with different names.</p><p>The world's your syntactic oyster, baby. Figure out a syntax and make it happen or, better yet, delegate the work to someone else.</p></body></html></div><script type="text/javascript">hljs.highlightAll();</script></div></div></body></html>
