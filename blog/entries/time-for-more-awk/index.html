     <p><a href="/blog/entries/grokking-awk">Last time around</a>, we gawked at awk. I'm following up here with a couple recipes I've used recently, at least as a handy reference for myself.</p>
     <h1 id="ratcheting-up-the-matching">Ratcheting Up The Matching</h1>I mentioned that <a href="/blog/entries/grokking-awk#meeting-our-matches">match expressions can be arbitrarily complex</a>.
     <p>One thing I've found that really handy for is selecting things like long-running requests since you can match on the request duration. So, with a <code>request.log</code> like:</p>
     <pre><code>01:52:30 /blog 200 2
02:24:41 /projects 200 5
03:05:51 /blog 500 4000
04:21:16 /projects 200 1
05:49:27 /blog 200 2</code></pre>
     <p>You can print out the slow request lines with:</p>
     <pre><code>awk '$NF &gt; 1000 { print }' request.log

# 2021-12-04T03:05:51 /blog 500 4000</code></pre>
     <h1 id="pairing-patterns">Pairing Patterns</h1>Another neat awk feature we didn't touch on last time is that you can match a <i>range</i> of records by combining two patterns with a <code>,</code>. awk will match the records <i>between</i> the two patterns, effectively "turning on" matching with the first and "turning off" with the second.
     <p>Think of it like a delicious textual sandwich, with your tasty content sitting between the two patterns. Okay, maybe this analogy isn't exactly the greatest thing since sliced bread.</p>
     <p>Anyway, this is handy, for example, to filter by time slices. With the <code>request.log</code> above, we can print out the requests between 2am and 4am by matching on <code>2</code> to start and <code>4</code> to stop:</p>
     <pre><code>awk '$1 ~ "T02", $1 ~ "T04" { print }' request.log

# 2021-12-04T02:24:41 /projects 200 5
# 2021-12-04T03:05:51 /blog 500 4000
# 2021-12-04T04:21:16 /projects 200 1</code></pre>
     <p>Note that the closing pattern is <i>inclusive</i>, so we scoop up that first 4am record.</p>
     <h1 id="joining-the-separator">Joining The Separator</h1>By default, awk will split up the fields in a record based on whitespace, but you can customize what it looks for.
     <p>Let's say our request log fields were separated by <code> - </code>:</p>
     <pre><code>2021-12-04T01:52:30 - /blog - 200 - 2
2021-12-04T02:24:41 - /projects - 200 - 5
2021-12-04T03:05:51 - /blog - 500 - 4
2021-12-04T04:21:16 - /projects - 200 - 1
2021-12-04T04:22:16 - /projects - 200 - 1
2021-12-04T05:49:27 - /blog - 200 - 2</code></pre>
     <p>You can pass the <code>-F</code> flag with the separator string to change how awk parses the records, so we can print the responses like so:</p>
     <pre><code>awk -F ' - ' '{ print $(NF-1) }' request.log

# 200
# 200
# 500
# 200
# 200
# 200</code></pre>
     <p>Without the <code>-F</code>, <code>$(NF1)</code> would refer to the last <code>-</code>, which isn't super useful.</p>
     <p>Even cooler, the separator string is actually a regex! So, if you wanted to split up the timestamp too, you could do:</p>
     <pre><code>awk -F 'T|( - )' '{ print $2 " " $(NF-1) }' request.log

# 01:52:30 200
# 02:24:41 200
# 03:05:51 500
# 04:21:16 200
# 04:22:16 200
# 05:49:27 200</code></pre>
     <p>(Ignoring how badly this breaks if there's a <code>T</code> somewhere else in the line)</p>
     <h1 id="tools-for-fools">Tools For Fools</h1>As a point of professional pride, I do want to stress that, in my day job, we do actually ingest our logs into a proper tool for querying and visualization, so all this awk stuff is somewhat primitive. However, for various dysfunctional reasons, it's been pretty handy to have alongside the fancier playthings.
     <p>I guess it's like a toolbox, y'know. Sure, you want all your fancy gadgets, but sometimes all you need is a hammer.</p>
