Some people might take a fortune of time like that and spend it doing something exciting and horizon-expanding like travelling. Me? Well, I'm more of a hide-in-my-room kind of guy.</p><p>What've I been doing with this time then? Some might claim long stints in front of my computer were symptomatic of a bone-deep laziness. Faced with this accusation, I throw up my hands and protest (in a squeaky voice) that this was my long-desired <em>PROJECT TIME</em>.</p><p>As my accuser turns away, I quickly drop my hands. Holding them up there is a lot of effort for these lazy bones.</p><p>Anyway, much as I've enjoyed taking this break and getting a chance to poke at some ideas which had been kicking around in my head, it's time for me to <del>mess up some interviews</del> find a job. However, I thought it'd be nice to have a summary of my work.</p><p>This isn't exactly an exhaustive list - there's a bunch stuff that never ended up online, whether because it was too uninteresting or too underdeveloped or whatever - but it is, indisputably, a list, and, well, there's something to be said for that.</p><h1>Games</h1><ul><li><a href="/projects/poplar">Poplar</a>, a haXe-based match-three platformer.</li><li><a href="/projects/herrera">Herrera</a>, an experiment with HTML5 and procedural generation.</li><li><a href="/projects/the-lauded-deeds-of-the-materialist">The Lauded Deeds of the Materialist</a>, a fun little action game.</li><li><a href="/projects/ruin">Ruin</a>, a ClojureScript-based roguelike built on top of <a href="http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/">rot.js</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/roguelim">roguelim</a>, a roguelike played through Twitter.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/a-sky-full-of-gumption">A Sky Full of Gumption</a>, the start of a Spelunky-inspired platformer.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>, a real-time game in ClojureScript (which ended up being way too slow).</li></ul><h1>Proceduralism</h1><ul><li><a href="/projects/midpoint-displacement-armor">Armor generation</a> with midpoint displacement.</li><li>Block leaf <a href="/projects/block-leaves">trees</a>.</li><li>Perlin noise-generated <a href="http://imgur.com/P7rFmNv">planets</a>.</li><li>Experiments in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1K5tk12.png">texture generation</a>.</li></ul><h1>Tools</h1><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/recaps">Updated tools</a> for the <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/CblogRecaps">Destructoid CBlog Recaps</a> team.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/emily">Emily</a>, the start of a Clojure-based paint program.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/jinn">Jinn</a>, a continuation of the CoffeeScript engine started in Herrera.</li></ul><h1>Websites</h1><ul><li>A ton of work for <a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/wits">this site</a>.</li><li>A website for <a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/web-coach">Colton Phillips</a>.</li></ul><h1>Languages</h1><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/go-forth">Go Forth</a>, a partial implementation of Forth in Go.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/cricket">Cricket</a>, a Lisp(ish) interpreter in CoffeeScript.</li></ul><h1>Miscellanea</h1><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/momo">Momo</a>, a Clojure-based implementation of monads.</li><li><a href="/projects/dabber">Dabber</a>, which applies a painterly effect to pictures.</li><li><a href="/projects/evolute">Evolute</a>, a song breeder.</li><li><a href="/projects/breedxel">Breedxel</a>, an image breeder.</li><li><a href="/projects/face-rater">Face Rater</a>, which rates faces.</li><li><a href="/projects/message-in-a-bottle">Message in a Bottle</a>, an experiment in communication.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Beyamor/nanogenmo-2013">An entry</a> for <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo">NaNoGenMo</a> which scraped  and blended Wikipedia articles.</li></ul></body></html></div><script type="text/javascript">hljs.highlightAll();</script></div></div></body></html>
